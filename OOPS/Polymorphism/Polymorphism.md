# Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming. It allows values of different data types to be handled using a uniform interface. There are two types of polymorphism:

## 1. Compile Time Polymorphism

In this type of polymorphism, the compiler knows which exact functions will be executed for a particular call. Some examples of compile time polymorphism include:

- **Function Overloading**: More than one method/function exists with the same name but with different signatures or possibly different return types.

- **Operator Overloading**: The same operator is used for operating on different data types.

### Overloading in Go

Go does not directly support method, function, or operator overloading, which are common features in many object-oriented languages. However, Go provides other ways to achieve similar outcomes.


Method overloading is not supported in Go. If you try to declare two methods with the same name but different parameters (as in Program-1), the compiler will throw an error. Here's an example of such an error:

```plaintext
.\main.go:11:16: method math.add already declared at .\main.go:7:16
.\main.go:18:23: too many arguments in call to mt.add
        have (number, number, number)
        want (int, int)

```


In Go, method overloading can be achieved using variadic functions. A variadic function is a function that can be called with varying numbers of arguments. 


The Program-2 is correct way of implementing method overloading in golang.

## 2. Run Time Polymorphism

RunTime Polymorphism means that a call is resolved at runtime. It is achieved in GO using interfaces.
